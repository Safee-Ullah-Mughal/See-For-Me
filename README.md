# SeeForMe

**SeeForMe** is a smart assistive vision system built using an **ESP32-CAM** and a custom mobile application. It performs **object detection** and **distance estimation** using **OpenCV**, then provides **text-to-speech (TTS)** feedback to help visually impaired users perceive their surroundings audibly and in real time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Software & Tools Used

* **OpenCV** (for object detection and distance estimation)
* **ESP32-CAM** firmware (for video streaming)
* **Custom Android App** (handles video stream, detection, and audio feedback)
* **Arduino IDE** (for ESP32-CAM programming)
* **Android Studio** ‚Äì Java for app development

## üìê Working Principle

1. ESP32-CAM streams live video to the mobile app over Wi-Fi.
2. The mobile app uses OpenCV to detect objects and estimate distances.
3. The app converts this information into spoken feedback using TTS.
4. The user hears object names and approximate distances in real-time.
